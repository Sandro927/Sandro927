## My Professional Background

I began programming with C++ and other object-oriented programming languages before transitioning and specializing in web development. After graduating College I participated in several online courses exploring
my interest in building web applications. I began developing with React.js and got hooked (no pun intendedüòÇ) and started to build my portfolio of React applications.
I was happy with my progress but still had a few too many questions that needed answering. I decided that I wanted to take a proper course from an accredited educational institution
and ended up at BrainStation in a 12-week BootCamp! I graduated in April of 2022 with a future-proof skillset, a comprehensive understanding of full-stack web development technologies
and rich portfolio of diverse applications showcasing these incredible 12 weeks of hard-work and commitment!
### üé∏ Beyond the Code üïπ

Apart from the countless hours I spent glued to my PC, I spend much of my free time hiking, fishing, cooking and gaming! I also play Bass Guitar in a Red Hot Chilli Peppers cover band and am a massive sports nut (hockey, soccer, baseball, basketball, football) to name a few!
